Ransomware is a type of software programs designed to take control, lock, damage or do other unwanted actions on a computer system. Ransomware may prevent user from accessing his/her computer, using his/her computer or accessing certain files unless the user pays a ransom. Ransomware it often encrypting files so that they cannot be opened. Ransomware may also be referred to as a crypto-worm, crypto-Trojan or crypto-virus.
Ransomware is typically installed in a system through a malicious email attachment, an exploit of software vulnerabilities, distributed as a Trojan via an infected software download and/or visiting a malicious website or link. Ransomware can be disguised as a legitimate file.
Once installed, it may lock your computer or render it inaccessible and display a screen with a message saying you must pay a ransom to regain the control of your computer, or regain the contents of your files. This may be a fake message purporting to be from a government institution like the FBI or Department of Defense saying you must pay a fine. It may also be a blatant ransom message saying your files are being held for ransom and you must pay to access them again. The ransom message typically includes instructions for how to pay the fine, often by credit card or cryptocurrency. Ransom amounts range from less than $100 to several thousand dollars. Sometimes the ransomware attacks target the businesses and federal and local governments. That attacks are specially crafted to pass through the businesses/government defences, and infect the systems.
Some ransomware may allow the user to use the computer, but will prevent the user from opening certain files. When the user tries to open a file or directory encrypted by the ransomware, it may display a message or alert box stating the system is locked down, or the files are encrypted and being held for ransom and the user must pay a fee to regain access to it.
