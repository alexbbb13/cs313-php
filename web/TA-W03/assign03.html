 <!--Create an HTML form that posts data to a PHP form which handles the submission, processes the data and reports the results.
 Core Requirements

 Create an HTML form that contains the following components:

 Name (text)

 Email (text)

 Major (radio button) with the following options:

 Computer Science

 Web Design and Development

 Computer information Technology

 Computer Engineering

 Comments (text area)

 You do not need to style this HTML form per se, but each input should be labeled and separated from each other.

 Create a PHP script to handle this form, so that when the form is submitted, it captures the form data and produces a web page that displays:

 The user's name

 Their email address, with a "mailto:" link for the email address

 Their major

 Their comments

 Again, this data need not be styled, but it should be labeled and separated from each other.

 Use the POST method for your form submission.

 Add to your form a checkbox list for the continents the user has visited with the following options:

 North America

 South America

 Europe

 Asia

 Australia

 Africa

 Antarctica

 Then, modify your PHP page to read and display this list.
